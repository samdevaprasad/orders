This is the services module for our orders application.

I decided to use node.js and express due to simplicity. I kept all the logic in the app.js file.

If I was to make a production quality backend I would probably utilize Dropwizard because of all the out of box tools it comes with.  We use Dropwizard at Goldman and all this backend code would become Java instead of Javascript.
